How Do I Verify EPEL Repo?

You need to run the following command to verify that the EPEL repository is enabled. Once you ran the command you will see epel repository.

# yum repolist

# yum install python2-pip

# pip install --upgrade pip

# pip install ansible

# ansible --version
 
/usr/bin/ansible --version
ansible 2.6.2
  config file = None  ==> missing
  configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Oct 11 2015, 17:47:16) [GCC 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-9)]

# cd /tmp

# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg

# mkdir /etc/ansible

# cp- p /tmp/ansible.cfg /etc/ansible

# cd /etc/ansible

# touch hosts

# chmod 777 hosts


=================
=================

Create a normal user control node and all your managed hosts as well

From Control Node:

# useradd sverma
# passwd sverma
# su - sverma

Create the same users for all the managed hosts and also create .ssh at user's home directory

# useradd sverma
# passwd sverma
# su - sverma
# mkdir .ssh
# chmod 700 .ssh

Create password less authentication

# login to control node as sverma
# ssh-keygen
# ls -ltrd
# cd .ssh
# scp -p id_rsa.pub client1.example.com:/home/sverma/.ssh/authorized_keys
# scp -p id_rsa.pub client2.example.com:/home/sverma/.ssh/authorized_keys
# scp -p id_rsa.pub client3.example.com:/home/sverma/.ssh/authorized_keys

Verify your access, it should be password less from your control node to all your managed hosts

===============
===============

From Control Node:

# su - sverma
# vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[testing]
client1.example.com
client2.example.com
client3.example.com

ansible -m command -a "uptime" testing

==============
==============


For Administrative commands where it requires admin rights

From managed hosts

login to client1.example.com

visudo
sverma  ALL=(ALL)  PASSWD: ALL

Same for all the managed hosts

ansible -m command -a "lvdisplay" testing --become -K
